# mynotes

<h2>Project Description:</h2><br/>
A simple web application built with Python/Django for the backend and Javascript/React for the frontend.<br/>
I used React hooks for note management in the application.<br/>
Used Django rest_framework for rest API.<br/>
The app records the date a new note is created, and also when you've edited a note.<br/>
The most recent note is also moved to the top of the list when you go back to the main screen.<br/>
